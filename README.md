Frontend Mentor JavaScript Junior challenge. At first I was trying to align the background image in the body with the picture, but I realized that it is way easier to just put it inside the picture div and using position absolute. Now It's not necessary to align it.  It's weird that this project doesn't have hover examples. It's a fun little project regardless.
